            My wife and I met online on match.com back in late 2016 at the time we live in sunny South Florida. In early 2017 we packed up and let everything me know and moved to Colorado.
            We got married in 2020!!!!
            My son Ezra who I met when he was about to turn 2 is light of my life althouth he is not bioliogly mine let me tell you he acts just like I did. Now he is 6 getting ready for his first year of school!
            A little about me, I have been in the automovite world for well over 15 years. I went into real estate for about 2 years. I did really well
                in real estate but somthing was still missing. I went back to writing service for Toyota and have been back at that for over 2 years now.
                When Covid-19 hit in early 2020 I knew it was time to strat looking for a different path and time to leave automotive for good.
                That's when I found coding, I sat and thought about what is the world still going to need in 25-45 years from now.
                That's when it hit me in the head, Technology is not going any where and it's only getting stronger. So now I work full time about 65 hours a week,
                and when I get home I spend a littl time with the fam and then start my night doing somethning on Coding Temple. I hope to be finished with Bootcamp by early 2020.
